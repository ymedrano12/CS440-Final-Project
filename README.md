# Tool Competition - Skill Classification

## Competition Overview

The 2027 competition consists of building and assessing multi‑label classifiers that predict, for each issue, the set of domains and sub‑domains representing the skills required to solve it.


## Dataset

We release a dataset mined from 7,245 merged pull requests across 11 popular Java repositories (57,206 source files; 59,644 methods; 13,097 classes) annotated with 217 skill labels composed by domain/sub‑domains You may find the dataset in a SQLite database, named `skillscope_data.db`, [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLBSE/SkillCompetition). This dataset is an updated version of the one submitted in the original [SkillScope](#citing-relevant-work) paper.

### Ready-made Table
Inside the database you will find a table named `nlbse_tool_competition_data_by_issue` that joins each pull request’s textual and code‑context features with its canonical domain/sub‑domain labels per issue. There is also a view `vw_nlbse_tool_competition_data_by_file` that labels each filename/function associated with each issue. 

- The `nlbse_tool_competition_data_by_issue` table contains a column for each domain and subdomain with an integer count of the number of matching APIs found for that issue. A value greater than zero indicates that domain/subdomain is present in the issue.

- The `vw_nlbse_tool_competition_data_by_file` is present for convenience purposes only and will not be used in evaluation of the model.

### Additional Metadata/Input Data is Allowed
Your model is allowed to use input data that is outside what is given in the database. You may use additional GitHub APIs to fetch more metadata, or download relevant files in an issue for further analysis. However, you must not use any third-party classification engine or the outputs present in `skillscope_data.db` as direct inputs to the model. 

### Baselines
Your models will be compared against the SkillScope Random‑Forest + TF‑IDF baselines reported in the paper by evaluating the overall prediction metrics against the issue classifications as recorded in the `nlbse_tool_competition_data_by_issue` table. The models you create should return a multi-label classification encoded in an one-hot encoded vector. However, it is the metrics of your models which will be the subject to the evaluation instead of the specific model output. Random Forest Baseline is provided in the folder `competition_baseline` with README and requirements.txt.

### Goal
Train, tune and evaluate your models on the provided splits and improve at least one of precision, recall, or micro‑F1 while not decreasing the remaining metrics relative to the best baseline.

## Organizers

The skill classification competition is organized by: Fabio Santos (fabio.deabreusantos@colostate.edu), and Jacob Penney (jmp458@nau.edu)

## Submission Acceptance & Competition

Submissions will first be filtered to ensure they do not lower any of the three core metrics (precision, recall, micro‑F1) compared with the baseline. Among qualifying submissions, ranking is determined by the largest positive improvement in micro‑F1. Ties will be broken by (1) precision, then (2) runtime.

Submissions will be judged on:
- Clarity and completeness of the paper.
- Availability and reproducibility of code/tool (open‑source required).
- Correct reporting of metrics.
- Quality of documentation.

Accepted papers will appear in the **NLBSE ’27 proceedings**.

### Ranking Details

Participants submit a single multi‑label classifier. Rankings proceed in two stages:

1. Eligibility check: The submission must *not* reduce any of precision, recall, or micro‑F1 compared with the baseline.
2. Ordering: Qualifying submissions are ordered by the greatest positive ∆micro‑F1.
